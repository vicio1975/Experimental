#### Pitot Tube

This is an application for the estimation of the average velocity of the air flow inside a tube.

The application is mainly built for a specific application, airflow system and fan, but could be used for general purposes.


The instrument used to this purpose is a static Pitot tube. 
The application has a GUI.



*Main features: 

> input atmospheric parameters (temperature and air pressure);

> input of the dynamic pressure values;

> correction of the dynamic pressures and estimation of the averaged spatial value;

> estimatation of the flow developed power inside a duct and a fan system.

> estimation of the system performance.

> save the results on a csv file (to be tested!).



*Future developments:
